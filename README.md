## Other Setup

From [EasyOpenCv Readme](https://github.com/OpenFTC/EasyOpenCV/blob/master/readme.md)
```
Because EasyOpenCv depends on OpenCV-Repackaged, you will also need to copy libOpenCvAndroid453.so
from the /doc/native_libs folder of that repo into the FIRST folder on the USB storage of the Robot
Controller (i.e. connect the Robot Controller to your computer with a USB cable, put it into
MTP mode, and drag 'n drop the file) .
```
